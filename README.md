# My-2nd-Piscine-Journey
Isn't it nice to just have a copy of your piscine progress online on your github? Featuring heavily 'inspired' work from other fellow 42 students including my piscine lab partner "Bean", you'll find just how we managed to ace the 2024 August piscine 👏💪 
I've uploaded this just for le memories and if anyone's wandered into this gitpage somehow in search for reference (which I honestly doubt xD) have fun poking around the project just don't do what we did xD

Imma update this page later with my story & some advice (and might upload my first piscine Journey too!)

## <ins>**READ THIS BEFORE PROCEEDING**</ins>: Grab a notebook, take out yo keyboard, && try to solve some of the exercises yourself. Unless you're feeling too lazy, feel free to analyze the code and understand it- but DON'T copy and paste it!! Instead try out different solutions even if it means adding a new function to your code :)))
